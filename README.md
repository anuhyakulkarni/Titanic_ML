# Titanic_ML
KNN and logistic Machine Learning algorithms applied to predict deaths from titanic 

The project contains four files .KNN_RAW ,LOGISTIC_RAW -both of which have raw codes/algorithms 
,while Logistic.py and titanic_knn.py have used inbuilt functiond from sklearn.... of the titanic passenger survival dataset .

Dataset description:The dataset has a set of 12 columns ,namely:passenger ID, passenger class, name, sex, age, sibsp,parch,ticket,fare,embarked and survived.

AIM: predict the survival of the passengers in titanic disaster and also the accuracy with which the predictions are made
