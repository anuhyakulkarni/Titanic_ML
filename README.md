# Titanic_ML
KNN and logistic Machine Learning algorithms applied to predict deaths from titanic 

The project contains two files . Logistic.py and titanic_knn.py ,each containing seperate projects of the titanic passenger survival dataset .
Dataset description:The dataset has a set of 12 columns ,namely:passenger ID, passenger class, name, sex, age, sibsp,parch,ticket,fare,embarked and survived.

The project trains models using knn and logistic algorithms available from sklearn to predict the survival of the passengers in titanic disaster and also the accuracy with which the predictions are made
